Assignment: 3, question 1

I created five java files that make up the program for a hospital.
To execute the program, all five java files need to be converted into class files using your machine's terminal.
If you installed the latest JDK into your machine, you could access the java files in your folder using the command cd in your terminal application.
Once you have located all five files, convert each one from .java into .class using the instruction javac. 
Starting from HospitalEmployee to Nurse, Doctor, Surgeon, and Hospital, convert the files into machine code. 
Upon completing this task, run the program executing java Hospital in the terminal. The program's output will be displayed immediately.
